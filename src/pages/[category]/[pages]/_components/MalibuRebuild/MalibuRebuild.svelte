    <h3>Dear Friends and Neighbors,</h3>
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>
        If you're like me and my neighbors that have had your homes damaged or
        completely burnt from the wildfires, I want to extend my hand to you and
        support you as much as I can. While rebuilding my own personal loss,
        I've brought my team together to be here as a help and guide to work
        with you and build a new home. With 20 years of architectural experience
        I'm expecting to go through some obstacles given the size of this
        disaster. We will need to go through a learning process as we work with
        the authorities and help them to accommodate us; however, if we take
        this on as a community, we'll be able to overcome these obstacles more
        accurately and promptly.
      </p>
